    <h2 id="about-me">About Me:</h2>
    <p id="miDIV">Hello there, I am a Software engineer from Brooklyn, New York. I love learning new ways to make code
      more consice and efficient. I am fluent in HTML, CSS, and still perfecting Javascript. When I am not coding, you
      can find me at the gym or at a NYC restaurant.
      I am eager to leverage my tech skills and background in Forensic Psychology to provide both a technological and a
      human behavioral perspective to any product I work on (particularly the UI/UX).

      A future goal on mine is creating an app that will work on leaderships skills in underrepresented communities. I
      want to give back to communities and continue diversifying not only the tech industry but the professional
      industry as well. I am humbled with the skills I have acquired through out my journey and know the importance of
      being supportive and genuine in order to be an affective future leader. I will use my leadership and management
      skills to contribute to a team in my tech journey.

      I am a lifelong learner and when I'm not taking classes or coding, you can find me reading (audiobooks =
      quarantine hobby) and trying different cuisines in an effort to continuously heighten and experience different
      perspectives.

    <h3>DIYPizza</h3>


    <p id="myDIV">"There is no Pizza like in NYC". As a New Yorker, I can agree with that quote. I have been to
      different states but not even Chicago Pizza beats New York City. With that being said, I wanted to build an
      adventure game that takes you to a pizza shop BUT ... also let's you build your own. Sounds like a dream, although
      sometimes it can seem a bit overwhelming when there is so many options to choose from. Luckily, in my game, it
      breaks it down into options. For instance, some players may be vegan, or veggitarian, and I was able to include
      those options as well. Furthermore, once you have selected your pizza type, it allows you to chose 3 toppings! How
      exciting! I was close to giving more topping availability but 3 sounded too perfect. Not too much where the pizza
      is heavy and messy, but definately more than two. The player gets to choose any 3 our of 5 options provided and
      then given an option to choose how many slices they want it cut. My mouth is watering as I think about how amazing
      it would be to get a bigger or smaller slice than usual. After all this fun, it is now time to look at your pizza
      summary and enjoy! üçï </p>

    <h3>Snowman</h3>
    <p id="laDIV">I'm sure you have heard of the game "Hangman". Well, Snowman is the new and improved version of it.
      The reason I say this is because the random word list is SUPER long which is amazing. If you are a competitve
      player like I am, then I can assure you that you will be playing Snowman for a while...unless you really are good.
      Not only is this game super fun and challenging, but it also gives you different number of chances everytime. The
      longer the word, the more chances you have, but you better hope they are the correct letters guessed for it to
      count. In addition to different number of chances, you are not limited to the amount of times you can guess a new
      word. So you can never say you are bored! Now, I know you want to play, so let me know how it goes! That is
      if...you win.‚òÉÔ∏è</p>
